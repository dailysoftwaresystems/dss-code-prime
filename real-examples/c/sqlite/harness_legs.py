"""THE SQLITE HARNESS LEG RESOLVER — one host-independent answer, two drivers.

D-HARNESS-CROSS-HOST-ANY-TARGET item (2): "de-host-lock the harness so any
(host, target) pair builds".

WHAT THIS REPLACES.  `build-and-test.sh` built its leg list out of `uname`
(`add_leg host $(host_target_spec)`, plus an arm64 leg only when the host was
Linux/x86_64 — so pe64 and macho were unreachable from it), and
`build-and-test.ps1` opened with `if (-not $IsWindows) { Die ... }` over a single
hardcoded `$Spec = 'x86_64:pe64-x86_64-windows-exec'`.  Both scripts therefore
answered "which targets does this harness build?" with "whatever this machine
is", which is the exact inverse of the requirement.

THE SPLIT THIS FILE ENFORCES.  Two questions that used to be one:

  * CAN THIS HOST **BUILD** TARGET T?  — ALWAYS YES, and it is not a host
    question at all.  DSS selects its target from config; a leg's build is
    attempted on every host, unconditionally.  A build can still FAIL (a
    compile error → `poisoned`) or be unable to START because a DECLARED input
    is absent from the machine (→ `skipped-build-input-missing`), but neither
    outcome is ever inferred from the host's identity: both are OBSERVED, and
    both are reported by name.
  * CAN THIS HOST **EXECUTE** T's ARTIFACT? — the one legitimate host question.
    Answered from the leg's own declaration: natively when the host OS is in
    `runOn` and the host arch is the target's, otherwise through a DECLARED
    launcher (qemu for a cross-arch host, Wine for a cross-OS one), otherwise
    not at all — and "not at all" is a NAMED verdict, never silence.

THE VERDICT VOCABULARY IS NOT THIS FILE'S.  It is the closed set in
`tests/test_support/arm_verdict_ledger.hpp`, reused verbatim so the sqlite
harness and the two examples-corpus harnesses classify a non-run the same way
and a reader can grep one set of names across all three.  `--verdict-vocabulary`
prints it, and `tests/harness/test_sqlite_harness_legs.cpp` asserts the printed
list is EXACTLY `armVerdictName()` over `kAllArmVerdicts`, in order — so the
duplication of those strings into Python cannot drift without a red test.

PYTHON, AND WHY.  The decision must have ONE implementation: this project has
already paid for the alternative (build-and-test.ps1's header records a
capability that existed in the .sh and not in the .ps1, so a CI driver exporting
DSS_COMMIT got an assertion on one leg and silence on the other — "a capability
in one driver and not the other is a silent harness bug").  Python is the only
language both drivers already hard-require (the .sh does `ensure_cmd python3`
before generating a manifest; the .ps1 gates on python3 in its Step 1), and the
repo already uses the python-core/thin-shell-wrapper shape in scripts/.

# invisible until a leg silently fails to appear, and by then hours have been
# spent. The load-bearing assertion is HOST-INVARIANCE OF THE BUILD SET.

# Every host this project has ever run a leg on, plus two it has not (the
# unknown-arch and unknown-OS rows). A host the resolver does not recognise must
# still produce a full build set — falling back to "build nothing" would be the
# host-locking defect wearing a different hat.
