# Plan 24 — Iterative Expression+Statement Traversal (close D-PARSE-DEEP-NEST-RECURSION-MEMORY)

**Status:** 🟦 GO — staged build (branch feature/0-0-2-p14, 2026-06-23). Plan-lock v1 = REWORK →
design v2 folds every finding (§4 ledger). User signed off the corrected six-family scope (4th
confirmation) + authorized "as many cycles as needed"; backup branch
`feature/0-0-2-p14-before-rework` exists for comparison. **Stage 1 (semantic `subtreeType`) ✅
DONE**; **Stage 2 (semantic `pass1`/`pass2`) ✅ DONE** (output-identity 376 ctest +
deep nested-block scope pin) — Stage 3 (`cst_to_hir` expr) next.

## §0 — Decision provenance & HONEST (corrected) scope

User chose **"Full iterative rewrite"** 3× with full disclosure: NOT a crash fix (all passes
already run on a 64 MiB `callOnLargeStack` worker), NO production consumer (valid C nests ≤4),
highest-risk multi-cycle surgery, pursued as a **robustness goal** ("robust before complete").

**★ Plan-lock v1 correction (re-disclose at sign-off): the surface is SIX recursion families,
not four passes** — the design must reflect this and the cycle/risk estimate rises accordingly:
1. Parser `parseExpressionAt` (expr) — speculation stays recursive (bounded 8).
2. CST→HIR `lowerExpr` (expr) **+ its re-entry into statement lowering** (comma → `ExprStmt`,
   `classifyLvalue` prep stmts).
3. CST→HIR statement lowering (the stmt tier `lowerExpr` re-enters; blocks/if/while nest).
4. HIR→MIR `lowerExpr` (expr) **+ `lowerStmt`** (`hir_to_mir.cpp:4237`; SeqExpr/comma →
   `lowerStmt` → nested stmt bodies → `lowerExpr`). Statement nesting is the DEEPER axis.
5. Semantic `pass1`/`pass2` (whole-tree walk) + `subtreeType` (expr typer).
6. Const-eval — CST `evalImpl` (`cst_const_eval.cpp:69`) + HIR `evaluateConstant`
   (`const_eval.cpp`); on the `int a[((((1)))) ]` / global-init deep paths.

**★ BC-1 (fail-loud, NON-NEGOTIABLE): the cap is NEVER removed.** Stage-final raises
`maxExpressionDepth` to a high explicit ceiling (e.g. 1,000,000) and keeps `P_ExpressionTooDeep`
as the positioned backstop. The `large_stack_call` worker is RETAINED for every recursion NOT
yet proven flat (esp. type-node/declarator recursion — C-2, OUT of scope). The cap-lift is gated
on a **proven-flat checklist** covering all six families; dropping the large-stack reliance is
scoped to ONLY the proven-flat (expression+statement+const-eval) path.

## §1 — Shared technique (plan-lock: SOUND — unchanged)

Each recursive `R(node)→result` becomes a driver loop over an explicit `std::vector<Frame>`
work-stack; each `Frame` is a POD `{node, uint8_t phase, <per-level locals>, <child-result slots>}`.
A phase either pushes a child frame + advances its own phase, or finishes and delivers its result
into the parent frame's phase-keyed slot. Interleaved side effects (CFG block emission, scope
push, HIR/ExprStmt emission) become phase transitions. **Mutual recursions share ONE work-stack
with a frame-KIND tag** (parser {Climb,Primary,AtomDrive}; cst_to_hir {Expr,Lvalue,Stmt};
hir_to_mir {Value,Address,Stmt}). **THE gate = OUTPUT-IDENTITY:** byte-identical CST/HIR/MIR/Type/
diagnostics/arena-order vs the recursive version, enforced by the full 374-test suite green after
every stage + the deep differential pins below (§3).

## §2 — The hard parts (plan-lock-corrected)

**Parser (SF-1 restated):** NOT "suspend/resume a loop." `parseUntilFrameDepth` is stateless
(`while frames.size()>targetDepth { stepOnce() }`, parser.cpp:1146) — all real state is already
heap. Hoist `parseExpressionAt`+`parsePrimary`+`parseUntilFrameDepth` into ONE unified driver with
frame kinds {Climb,Primary,AtomDrive}; an AtomDrive frame's "resume" is just "re-test the depth
predicate → `stepOnce` again or pop." **SF-1 correctness item: the watchdog tuple
(`lastCursor/lastTokPos/lastDepth`, currently one `Impl`-level tuple, parser.cpp:1390) must become
a per-AtomDrive-frame snapshot** so an inner climb can't desync the outer drive's stall detector.

**Parser speculation (SF-2 — THE top silent-desync risk):** speculation stays recursive (bounded
8), but `trySpeculativeBranch`→`walkExpression`→`parseExpressionAt`(iterative) means a live
`SpeculationProbe` WRAPS the iterative climb. The probe dtor (parser.cpp:1035-1066) restores
`frames`/walker/builder/tokens/sketch but knows nothing of the NEW climb work-stack → a rolled-back
probe leaves orphan climb frames → desync. **FIX: `SpeculationProbe` snapshots a `climbDepthBefore_`
at construction and pops the climb work-stack back to it in the dtor, mirroring the `frames`
restore at 1048-1053.** Pin: a speculative cast-vs-paren probe that rolls back AT depth, asserting
the climb stack is empty after.

**HIR→MIR CFG arms (MF-1):** Ternary (1071)/LogicalAnd-Or (1106) are 3-4 phase diamonds recording
predecessor block IDs BETWEEN child lowerings (frame holds `thenBB/elseBB/joinBB/lhsPred/...`).
SeqExpr (1394) re-enters `lowerStmt` → the work-stack frame-kind set MUST include {Stmt}; statement
nesting is a first-class stage (4b), not "a stmt-index cursor."

**CST→HIR (MF-2):** `lowerExpr↔classifyLvalue` mutual recursion + `classifyLvalue` synthesizes prep
stmts; expr lowering is reached FROM statement lowering. Frame-kind set {Expr,Lvalue,Stmt}.
`lowerFlatExpr` (SQL) shares the `combineBinary` helper but has its own driver (C-1) → its own
frame kind.

## §3 — Staging (re-organized for six families; gating; risk)

| # | Stage | Risk | Per-stage gate (all + full 374 ctest green = OUTPUT-IDENTITY) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | semantic `subtreeType` ✅ **DONE** | low | OUTPUT-IDENTITY 374→375 ctest green + corpus `deep_subtree_type_dim` (200-deep parens around a `long long` in an array-dim `sizeof`, typed at Pass-1.5 on the UNSTAMPED CST → 8 → exit 42, value-sensitive). **Validation deviation (honest):** the planned isolated small-stack unit pin (SF-4) was infeasible — BOTH `subtreeType` AND `EngineState` are anonymous-namespace (no test-callable seam without API pollution). Used a deep-CORRECTNESS corpus pin instead (big stack); the small-stack FLAT property is validated end-to-end at Stage 7. Used deep PARENS (Wrapper arm, ~150ms) not deep BINARY (parser-bound: 18s at depth 60 — the parser super-linearity this arc fixes at Stage 5, so a deep-binary pin is impractical until then). |
| 2 | semantic `pass1`/`pass2` ✅ **DONE** | low-med | OUTPUT-IDENTITY 375→376 ctest green + corpus `deep_stmt_scope_walk` (150 nested block scopes; pass1 builds a 150-deep scope chain, pass2 walks it + the innermost `return base` resolves through all 150 scopes → exit 42, value-sensitive). Conversion: extracted per-node helpers (`pass1Node` returns the child scope `here`; `pass2Post` is the post-child handling, where a `return;` ends that node's post-work not the whole walk) + explicit-stack drivers — `pass1` pre-order (pop→work→push children), `pass2` two-phase post-order (phase 0 resolve scope/loopDepth+push children, phase 1 `pass2Post`); children pushed in reverse for source-order LIFO; realloc-safe (copy frame fields before any push_back). Deep BLOCKS (parse O(N), no expr speculation) not deep binary. |
| 3 | cst_to_hir `lowerExpr`+`lowerFlatExpr` ({Expr,Lvalue}) | **HIGH** (reassessed) | **DESIGN READY, not yet built — the hard crux.** Full CPS defunctionalization: a result stack `std::vector<E>` + a continuation work-stack of tagged `Step`s (EvalNode | Apply{kind}). Per-arm Apply kinds (~15): BinaryCombine, CommaMid (emit ExprStmt after lhs, then EvalNode rhs), CommaFinish (makeSeqExpr), AssignFinish, UnaryCombine, TernaryAfterCond (coerceCondition→EvalNode then), TernaryAfterThen (→EvalNode else), TernaryFinish (coerce both + makeTernary), PostfixCallArg (arg-loop cursor), PostfixCallFinish, PostfixIndexFinish (promote + makeIndex), CastFinish, MemberFinish, OperandPassthrough; PostInc/Dec + Assign route through `classifyLvalue` which re-enters EvalNode (the {Lvalue} mutual-recursion tag). Interleaved emission (Comma ExprStmt / SeqExpr build / Call arg accumulation) preserved by splitting into the intermediate Apply steps. THE GATE stays OUTPUT-IDENTITY (376 ctest) PLUS a HIR-arena/ExprStmt-order differential pin for NESTED comma/assign/post-inc/ternary (the corpus is shallow there — plan-lock SF-3) + a deep-PAREN compile+run corpus pin. Realloc-safety: capture before push. Reassessed HIGH-risk (compiler-core lowering, ~500 LOC) → do as a dedicated focused cycle with fresh context, NOT rushed. |
| 3b | cst_to_hir statement tier ({Stmt}) | med | synthetic deep block/if/while nest lowered on a small stack |
| 4 | hir_to_mir `lowerExpr`+`lowerLvalueAddress` ({Value,Address}) | **high** | **MIR differential pin: block-emission order + phi-predecessor IDs** for nested `?:`/`&&`/`\|\|`/member-index chains (the exact thing a phase bug corrupts) |
| 4b | hir_to_mir `lowerStmt` ({Stmt}) | **high** | synthetic deep stmt nest → flat MIR on a small stack |
| 5 | parser `parseExpressionAt` unified driver + SF-1 + SF-2 | **high** | deep parse on a small stack; CST token-stream/tree-shape differential pin for mixed-assoc (`a-b-c` left, `a=b=c` right, `a?b:c?d:e`); speculation-rollback-at-depth pin |
| 6 | const-eval `evalImpl` (CST) + `evaluateConstant` (HIR) | med | deep const-expr in array-dim + deep global-init folded on a small stack |
| 7 | lift cap (256→1e6, KEEP `P_ExpressionTooDeep`) + scope-down large-stack reliance to the proven-flat path + e2e example | med | `examples/c-subset/deeply_nested_expression_iterative` (depth ~5000, currently fails the cap) compiles+runs to a known exit on the DEFAULT stack; RED-on-disable: re-impose 256 → `P_ExpressionTooDeep` |

**SF-3/SF-4/SF-5 (the oracle is too shallow without these):** the 374 corpus exercises the hard
arms only at depth 1-4. Each stage 3-5 MUST add a **byte-identical differential pin** capturing the
exact structure a phase bug corrupts (MIR: phi-predecessor IDs + block order; HIR: arena + ExprStmt
order; CST: token stream + tree shape), produced by **synthetically-built deep trees** (SF-4 — the
parser can't emit beyond the cap until Stage 5, so stages 1-4 build deep inputs via the public
`TreeBuilder`/HIR/MIR builders, not by parsing). Each stage 1-6 adds a **temporary test-only
beyond-cap override** (SF-5) raising ONLY that pass's reachable depth past 256 on a small stack +
asserting no overflow AND output-identity vs the big-stack recursive result at depth ~1000 — the
only way to validate the small-stack property per-stage before the global cap lift.

**Staging invariants:** no stage lifts the global cap until Stage 7. Each stage is OUTPUT-IDENTICAL
(the 374 suite + differential pins are the oracle) and commits independently green + independently
pr-reviewed (bounded blast radius per commit). Agnostic throughout (host-stack mechanics, BC-2 PASS).

## §4 — Plan-lock v1 findings ledger (all addressed in v2)

- **MF-1** (MIR expr re-enters `lowerStmt`) → Stage 4b + {Stmt} frame kind + statement-nest pins. ✅
- **MF-2** (CST→HIR same stmt coupling) → Stage 3b + {Stmt} frame kind. ✅
- **MF-3** (two const-eval recursions on the cap-lift path) → Stage 6 (first-class) + BC-1 gating. ✅
- **SF-1** (parser CRUX is a unified 3-kind driver, not suspend/resume; per-frame watchdog) → §2. ✅
- **SF-2** (SpeculationProbe must restore the climb work-stack) → §2 + Stage-5 rollback pin. ✅
- **SF-3** (oracle too shallow) + **SF-4** (synthetic deep trees) + **SF-5** (per-stage beyond-cap
  override) → §3 per-stage gates. ✅
- **BC-1** (never remove the cap; keep large-stack for unproven recursions) → §0 + Stage 7. ✅
- **BC-3** (re-disclose true six-family scope) → §0; surfaced to user before Stage 1. ✅
- **C-1** (`lowerFlatExpr` own driver) → Stage 3 own frame kind. **C-2** (type-node/declarator
  recursion OUT of scope; large-stack retained) → §0. **C-3** (binder sketch / oracle reparse
  byte-identity) → Stage-5 sketch-output pin.
