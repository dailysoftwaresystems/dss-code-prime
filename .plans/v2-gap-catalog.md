# DSS Code Prime — v2 Gap Catalog

> Empirically discovered gaps from authoring `src/source-config/languages/c-subset.lang.json`
> against the v1 schema. Format defined in [`schema-expressiveness-v2-plan.md`](./schema-expressiveness-v2-plan.md) §4.1.
>
> Each row = one C language construct the v1 schema can't express cleanly. **"Resolves via"**
> points at the §5 subsection / PR that closes the gap. Branches per §4.1:
>
> - **(a)** small extension fits naturally → amend §5; record a design-diff line in this row's notes.
> - **(b)** large extension out of PR scope → log in §9 of the v2 plan with trigger.
> - **(c)** out of v2 scope entirely → log in §9 with rationale.
>
> PR0's `c-subset.lang.json` was authored **conservatively**: where v1 couldn't express a feature,
> we omitted the construct rather than working around it. This catalog enumerates what we omitted
> so PR1+ has a target list.

## 0. Source for every row

`c-subset.lang.json` committed alongside this catalog. To reproduce: `GrammarSchema::loadShipped("c-subset")` — loads cleanly under the v2 loader. Every gap below is "loader accepted, but the resulting grammar is semantically incomplete or wrong-shaped for real C source."

## 1. Gaps from PR0 (c-subset authoring)

| # | Symptom                                                      | Source / JSON site                          | Diagnostic                                                            | Resolves via                          | Sample                                  |
|---|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1 | ~~`a + b * c` parses left-fold.~~ **Schema-side data landed in PR1**: `c-subset.lang.json` now declares the full C precedence table via `operators.groups`, queryable through `GrammarSchema::operatorTable().lookup(kind, arity)`. **Tree shape is still wrong** because no parser yet consumes the table — the flip happens when a Pratt walker lands in the parser phase. Test `CSubsetEndToEnd.ExpressionWithMixedOpsIsLeftFolded` stays pinned until then; `CSubsetEndToEnd.OperatorTableMatchesCPrecedence` proves the data is in place. | `shapes/expression`, `shapes/binaryOp`, `operators.groups` | none — loader accepts | **§5.1 (PR1) — data ✅**; tree-shape flip awaits parser phase | `1 + 2 * 3;`, `a = b = c;` |
| 2 | `typedef int MyInt; MyInt x;` can't distinguish `MyInt` as a type later — `Identifier` is unconditional in v1. **Schema-side mechanism landed in PR2b**: contextual keywords + `expectedSet(cursor)`-driven demotion. The typedef-symbol-table side (`MyInt` resolving to a user-defined type kind based on prior `typedef` declarations) is parser/semantic-pass work; the schema can't express it declaratively. | `keywords` / `Identifier` resolution        | none — loader accepts, parser produces wrong-typed leaves              | **§5.2 (PR2b) — mechanism ✅**; typedef-aware demotion awaits parser + semantic pass | `typedef int MyInt;`<br>`MyInt v;` |
| 3 | ~~`//` line comments and `/* */` block comments cannot be marked `EmptySpace` declaratively.~~ **Schema-side mechanism shipped in PR5**: `lexerModes` + `LexerModeStack` + `modeOp` (`pushMode`/`popMode`/`replaceMode`) on `LexemeMeaning`. A "comment" mode with `defaultToken: { kind: "CommentChar", flags: ["EmptySpace"] }` (once per-mode inline tokens lands) plus a top-level `"//"` that triggers `pushMode: "comment"` will work end-to-end. Tokenizer integration is parent plan #5's job. | (omitted from `tokens`)                     | n/a — feature absent from c-subset                                    | **§5.5 (PR5) — mechanism ✅**; comment-mode config authoring + tokenizer integration pending | `// hello`<br>`/* multi */`             |
| 4 | ~~String escape sequences treated as opaque chars; v1's `StringLiteral` had no per-language escape rules.~~ **Schema-side mechanism shipped in PR6**: `stringStyle` on string-opener token meanings with `escapeKind` (`char`/`doubled-delimiter`/`none`), `escapeChar`, `endsAt`, `endsAtLongestMatch`, `multiline`, `delimiterTag: "matched"` + `tagPattern`. Tokenizer integration is parent plan #5's job. | (relies on built-in `StringLiteral`)        | none — built-in token kind accepts, escapes round-trip as raw         | **§5.6 (PR6) — mechanism ✅**; tokenizer integration pending  | `"hello\nworld"`                        |
| 5 | ~~Char literal escapes (`'\n'`, `'\\''`) same problem.~~ **Schema-side mechanism shipped in PR6** (same `stringStyle` covers char literals — single-quoted delimiters with `escapeKind: "char"`). | (relies on built-in `CharLiteral`)         | none                                                                  | **§5.6 (PR6) — mechanism ✅**            | `'\n'`                                  |
| 6 | Pointer declarator/dereference `int *p; *p = 5;` — `*` is declared as `StarOp` (binary), no way to mark it postfix-after-typeRef or prefix-on-lvalue. | `tokens/*`, `shapes/binaryOp`, `shapes/operand` | builder eventually rejects: `*` consumed as binary leaves the LHS `int` dangling | §5.1 (PR1) — operator arity (`Prefix`/`Infix`/`Postfix` for `*`) + a typeRef-side change | `int *p;`<br>`*p = 5;`                  |
| 7 | Function calls `f(x, y)` — no postfix-call shape. `f` parses as `Identifier`, then `(` opens a new scope as `ParenOpen` mid-expression. | `shapes/operand`                            | none — loader accepts, but `f` and `(x,y)` are siblings, not a call    | §5.1 (PR1) — postfix arity OR an explicit call shape | `f(1, 2);`                              |
| 8 | Postfix `x++`, `x--` — same as #7, no postfix arity in v1.   | n/a — token omitted                         | n/a                                                                   | §5.1 (PR1) — postfix arity            | `i++;`                                   |
| 9 | ~~`for (init; cond; step) body` omitted from conservative cut.~~ **Added in PR0** as `shapes/forStmt`; init slot supports `varDeclHead` or `expression`. Inherits gap #1's precedence problem inside cond/step. | `shapes/forStmt`, `shapes/varDeclHead` (refactor) | n/a                                                                | **(a) — closed in PR0**                | `for (int i = 0; i < n; i = i + 1) ...` |
| 10 | ~~`do { ... } while (cond);` omitted from conservative cut.~~ **Added in PR0** as `shapes/doStmt`. | `shapes/doStmt`, `keywords/do`              | n/a                                                                   | **(a) — closed in PR0**                | `do { ... } while (x);`                 |
| 11 | ~~`switch / case / default / break` — `case` valid only inside `switch`.~~ **Schema-side mechanism landed in PR3**: `scopeRequire` with `anyOf` / `forbid` / `topMustBe` / `outermost`. A token entry marked `scopeRequire: { "topMustBe": "Block" }` is rejected unless `Block` is innermost. Adopting in c-subset requires opening a Switch-style scope at `switch (` and consulting `topMustBe` from `case` — config work for PR7 / language onboarding. | (omitted) → c-subset adoption pending | n/a                                                                   | **§5.3 (PR3) — mechanism ✅**; per-language Switch scope authoring pending | `switch (x) { case 1: ...; }`           |
| 12 | Arrays `int a[10]; a[0] = 1;` — `BracketOpen` declared but no array-decl-suffix or index-postfix shape. | `shapes/varDecl`, `shapes/operand`          | none                                                                  | §5.1 (PR1) — postfix arity (`[`)     | `int a[10];`<br>`a[0] = 1;`             |
| 13 | ~~`const` qualifier omitted from `typeRef`.~~ **Added in PR0**: `typeRef` is now `(optional ConstKeyword) typeBase (optional ConstKeyword)`. Tolerates both `const int x` and `int const x` (and redundantly `const int const x`, matching real C compilers). | `shapes/typeRef`, `shapes/typeBase`         | n/a                                                                   | **(a) — closed in PR0**                | `const int x = 5;`                      |
| 14 | Float literals — built-in `FloatLiteral` exists but C lexing (`3.14`, `1e10`, `1.0f`) needs longest-match + suffix rules. Not declarative in v1. | (omitted from `shapes/operand`)             | n/a                                                                   | §5.6 (PR6) — numeric-style descriptor (NOT in current v2 §5.6; v3 candidate) | `3.14`, `1e10f`                         |
| 15 | ~~Bitwise operators omitted for brevity.~~ **Added in PR0**: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>` as `BitAndOp`/`BitOrOp`/`BitXorOp`/`TildeOp`/`ShlOp`/`ShrOp`. `~` is a unary prefix in `operand`; the rest are binary. Inherits gap #1's precedence problem. | `tokens/&` `\|` `^` `~` `<<` `>>`; `shapes/binaryOp`, `shapes/operand` | n/a                                              | **(a) — closed in PR0**                | `x \| 0x80`, `~x`, `a << 2`            |
| 16 | Compound assignment `+= -= *= /=` — single-token multi-char ops; v1 token-key mechanism handles them, just omitted. Will inherit #1's precedence issue. | (omitted)                                   | n/a                                                                   | §5.1 (PR1) — once precedence lands, these slot in as right-assoc | `x += 1;`                               |
| 17 | Ternary `? :` — mixfix. v1 + v2 `Prefix`/`Infix`/`Postfix` enum doesn't model it. | (omitted)                                   | n/a                                                                   | **(c)** §9 item 1 of v2 plan — v3 candidate | `c ? a : b`                             |
| 18 | Multi-char operator longest-match (`==` vs `=`, `&&` vs `&`) — declared as separate `tokens` keys. v1 schema doesn't say how the tokenizer disambiguates; this is a **tokenizer-phase** concern, not a v2 schema concern. Flagged for the tokenizer phase to honor longest-match. | `tokens` keys: `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`, `&&`, `||` | none — schema-side                                                    | tokenizer phase (parent-plan #5)      | `if (a == b) ...`                       |

## 2. Gap-to-PR roll-up

| Resolves via                                                 | Rows                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| §5.1 (PR1) — operator precedence + associativity + arity     | 1, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16            |

## 3. Branch-(a) follow-up — closed in PR0

Per user decision (Q1 below), rows 9, 10, 13, 15 were landed in the same PR0 commit. They're v1-expressible and free to add — see the strike-throughs in the table.

## 4. Branch-(b)/(c) candidates surfaced by PR0

| Row | Branch | Trigger to revisit                                                                    |

---

## 5. Resolved open questions

- **Q1. Branch-(a) rows (9, 10, 13, 15) — landed in PR0** as a small extension on top of the conservative cut.
- **Q2. Hand-tokenized end-to-end test — landed in PR0** as `tests/core/test_c_subset.cpp`. Three tests:
  - `TopLevelVarDeclWithIntInitializer` — happy path through `varDecl` → `varDeclHead` → `typeRef` → `typeBase`.
  - `IfWithReturnInsideBlock` — happy path through `ifStmt` → `block` → `returnStmt`.
  - `ExpressionWithMixedOpsIsCurrentlyLeftFolded` — pins the current (wrong) left-fold shape for `a + b * c;`. Flipping the assertion when PR1 lands precedence is the visible signal that gap #1 is closed.
- **Q3. `dssSchemaVersion` — stays at `1`** in `c-subset.lang.json` (no v2-only fields used yet). PR1+ bumps to `2` when v2 fields appear.

---

## 6. Status

- **PR0:** ✅ shipped (commits `4aef654` + `3aca464`).
- **PR1:** ✅ shipped (commits `068b633` + `048953f`). OperatorTable + loader `operators` section + `expr` shape kind + c-subset operators (bumped to `dssSchemaVersion: 2`). Row 1 marked data-resolved; tree-shape flip awaits parser phase. Review followup hardened the table (key-packing fatal guard, duplicate-detect, shape-kind mutual exclusion, `expr` body allowlist) — see plan §0 "PR1 contracts established for downstream PRs".
- **PR2a:** ✅ shipped (`b571cf3` + review followup). Real `SchemaCursor` walker — compiled position tables, fixed-point FIRST/NULLABLE, per-position `nullableTail`, `expectedAt` dropped. Review followup added: Position-as-class with factories, ambiguity detection via `C_AmbiguousAlternatives`, empty-array / zero-shape-kind body errors, iteration caps on fixed points, c-subset refactored to disambiguate `topLevel`. Closes v1 §0 deviation #7. See plan §0 "PR2a deviations" + "PR2a contracts established for downstream PRs".
- **PR2b:** ✅ shipped + review-fixed (`03c6f22` + `9765791`). `LexemeMeaning.contextual` + `ReservedWordPolicy`. `TreeBuilder` walks `SchemaCursor` on open/close/pushToken; contextual keywords consult expectedSet(cursor) and demote when not expected. Row 2 (typedef contextual identifier) closer to resolved — the mechanism exists; the typedef-symbol-table side is parser work. Review followup added `P_SchemaCursorDesync` (one-shot info diagnostic on the first valid→invalid cursor transition), `GrammarSchema::routeToRuleLeaf` (AltChoice → RuleLeaf routing on `open()` so `leaveRule` stays valid for `repeat`/`optional`/`alt` parents), EmptySpace tokens skip cursor advance, and loader rejection of `kind:"Identifier" + contextual:true`. See plan §0 "PR2b deviations".
- **PR3:** ✅ shipped + review-fixed (`901ad62` + `55db3df`). `ScopeMatch { anyOf, forbid, topMustBe, outermost }` replacing v1's flat `validScopes`. Legacy syntax still loads. New `C_ConflictingField` (dual-field, wrong-type) and `C_UnknownScopeName` (replaces overloaded `C_UnclosableScope`). `C_RedundantScopeRequire` warnings on contradictions / oversized lists. Row 11 (`switch`/`case`/`default`/`break` — `case` valid only inside `Switch`) schema-side resolved.
- **PR4:** ✅ shipped + review-fixed (`9b1ca2c` + `40d8576`). `TreeBuilder::Checkpoint` (move-only RAII, rolls-back-by-default) snapshots arena + child-index + pendingChildren + open frames + scopes + cursor + cookies + reporter. `Frame::children` refactored to shared `pendingChildren_` staging vector. Loader plumbs `speculative: true` + `lookahead: N` on alt shapes; speculative alts exempt from ambiguity-detect. New codes: `P_MaxSpeculationDepth`, `P_UncommittedCheckpoint`, `P_BacktrackFailed`, `C_RedundantField`. Three real bugs fixed in review (recent_ deque restore, inner-commit-outer-rollback firstId math, no-op-guard dtor warning) + 16 test gaps closed.
- **PR5:** ✅ shipped + 2 review rounds (`10641af` + `0507a7c` + `d53d627`). `lexer_mode.{hpp,cpp}` ships `ModeOp` enum, `LexerMode` POD, `LexerModeStack` runtime with fatal-on-empty discipline + lenient opt-ins (`tryPop()`/`topOrInvalid()`) + `clear()`. Snapshot owner-stamp uses per-instance monotonic id (defeats address-recycling). `LexemeMeaning` gains `modeOp` + `modeArg`. Loader registers modes in Pass 1 (forward-ref resolution), populates per-mode tokens in Pass 2 ("main" inherits top-level; `tokens: "default"` inherits; inline objects warn). Auto-synthesizes "main" mode for v1 configs. `lexerModes()` returns `subspan(1)` to hide internal sentinel. Keywords reject `modeOp`/`modeArg`. Case-folded duplicate-mode warning. Orphan `defaultToken`-only mode warning. `lookupLexemeInMode` aborts on invalid id with id value in message. Row 3 (line/block comments as `EmptySpace`) schema-side resolved. New code: `C_UnknownLexerMode`.
- **PR6:** ✅ shipped + review-fixed (`283fbb2` + `3285eed`). New `string_style.{hpp,cpp}` with `EscapeKind` enum (`None`/`Char`/`DoubledDelimiter`) and `StringStyle` POD (escapeKind/escapeChar/endsAt/endsAtLongestMatch/multiline/tagPattern — `tagPattern.empty()` IS the dynamic-tag signal). `LexemeMeaning::stringStyleId` is a proper `DSS_STRONG_ID(StringStyleId)` (zero=invalid, dense 1..N with slot-0 sentinel — matches `LexerModeId` convention). New `DSS_STRONG_ID(SchemaId)` stamped onto every owned `LexemeMeaning` so cross-schema lookups (`stringStyle(m)` etc.) abort loudly. Loader fail-fasts on `escapeChar` with non-Char kind, `tagPattern` without `delimiterTag: "matched"`, and now warns on longest-match + 1-char endsAt. Regex compile catches `std::regex_error` THEN any `std::exception` (catches `bad_alloc` etc. instead of letting it propagate). Keywords reject `stringStyle` (`C_ConflictingField`). Rows 4 + 5 (string + char escape sequences) schema-side resolved. New code: `C_InvalidStringStyle`.
- **PR7:** ✅ shipped (`<commit pending review>`). Authored `src/source-config/languages/tsql-subset.lang.json` exercising the full v2 feature surface: `reservedWordPolicy: "contextual"` (every keyword soft); operator precedence table with infix + prefix `-`; bracket-quoted identifiers via stringStyle (`escapeKind: "doubled-delimiter"`, `endsAt: "]"`); single-quoted strings + N'unicode' strings sharing the doubled-quote escape rule; three lexer modes (`bracket-id`, `single-string`, `unicode-string`) each with a `defaultToken`; three-part naming `db.schema.table` via `qualifiedName` shape; SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE / CREATE TABLE statements. 19 tests in `test_tsql_subset.cpp` covering loader pins for every v2 mechanism + end-to-end TreeBuilder parses for every statement shape + a contextual-keyword demotion test (`CREATE TABLE SELECT ...` demotes SELECT to Identifier at qualifiedName position). v2's feature set is **empirically sufficient** for a non-trivial real grammar.
- **PR8:** ⏳ pending.

### Residual T-SQL gaps explicitly out of PR7 scope

These are real T-SQL features the subset deliberately omits per the plan §7 PR7 caps. None of them require new v2 schema mechanisms — they're authoring extensions that can be added to `tsql-subset.lang.json` post-v2 without further schema work.

| Feature | Trigger condition |
|---|---|
| `GO` batch separator | When the language onboarding plan targets full T-SQL (currently subset is enough for v2 stress). Implementable as a top-level token that closes the current statement-list and starts a new one. |
| Full `sys.*` system-function namespace | When the onboarding plan needs runtime stored-proc / view introspection. The schema mechanism (three-part naming + Identifier) already supports parsing the references; only the symbol table is missing. |
| CLR types (`Geography`, `HierarchyId`, etc.) | When a target deployment needs them. Implementable as additional `keywords[]` entries with `typeRef` alt arms. |
| Stored-procedure declaration / control flow (`BEGIN ... END`, `IF`, cursors, `TRY/CATCH`) | When onboarding targets server-side T-SQL execution. Mechanism-wise just more shapes; no new schema features needed. |
| `OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)` window clauses | Same. Shape work, not schema work. |

## 7. Gaps surfaced by PR2b review

These are NOT C-language gaps from c-subset authoring — they're internal walker/cursor gaps the PR2b review exposed. Tracking here so the parser phase (which will exercise the same machinery harder) doesn't rediscover them.

| # | Symptom | Site | Resolution |
|---|---------|------|------------|
| 19 | Schema cursor silently went off-track on every parse rooted at `repeat(X)` / `optional(X)` / `alt(...)` — `leaveRule` on a non-RuleLeaf saved cursor returns invalid. Contextual keyword resolution fell back to strict silently, hiding the desync. | `TreeBuilder::open` / `GrammarSchema::leaveRule` | **Closed in PR2b review followup.** New `routeToRuleLeaf(parentCur, rule)` walks AltChoice positions to find a `RuleLeaf(rule)` branch; `open()` saves that RuleLeaf so `leaveRule` resumes correctly. One-shot `P_SchemaCursorDesync` info diagnostic surfaces residual desyncs (e.g. when the caller drives an off-schema sequence). |
| 20 | `EmptySpace` tokens (whitespace) invalidated the cursor — whitespace isn't in any schema expected set, so `advance` returned invalid on every space. | `TreeBuilder::pushToken` | **Closed in PR2b review followup.** `pushToken` skips `schema_->advance` when the resolved meaning carries `NodeFlags::EmptySpace`. Whitespace is off-grammar by design. |
| 21 | Multi-level AltChoice nesting (an `alt` whose chosen branch is itself an `optional`/`alt` containing the target `RuleLeaf`) — `routeToRuleLeaf` recurses through nested AltChoice but is untested past two levels. | `GrammarSchema::routeToRuleLeaf` | **Open.** Flag for the parser phase: when real grammars start composing `alt` + `optional` + `repeat` arbitrarily, write a stress test that pushes nested-AltChoice routing through 3+ levels. |
| 22 | Demoted-contextual-keyword cursor advance: when a soft keyword demotes to Identifier, the cursor advances by `Identifier`'s schema-token-id (the demoted kind), not the original keyword. PR2b shipped this correctly but the test (`DemotedKeywordAdvancesCursorAsIdentifier`) only landed in review followup — easy to regress without the pin. | `tests/core/test_contextual_keywords.cpp` | **Pinned in PR2b review followup.** Keep the test alive as the parser phase grows. |
